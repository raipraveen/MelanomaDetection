# Project Name
> Melanoma Detection Assignment.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info](The main objective is to be able to identify Melanoma Detection)
* [Technologies Used](python 3.6)
* [Conclusions](##### **Findings from Model 3** Accuracy of training and validation has been increased significantly due to augmentation and class imbalnce handling. The model is  not overfitting. This model can be used as final model.)
* [Acknowledgements](**Training Accuracy:** 94.12, **Validation Accuracy:** 83)

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project? -- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve? To check the accurately of detect melanoma
- What is the dataset that is being used? Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration dataset
